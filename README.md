## Current Files

- subreddit_counts: Contains subreddit names for url links and member counts
- world-map.geojson: Contains geometry for countries on map
- script.js: Code to run d3.js and add functionality (modal popup + redirect)
- server.js: TO-DO, call AWS Database to update the top posts for each country


## Issues Now

- Slow color transition time -> Add loading screen?
- Modal does not appear directly at the location of the cursor
- Modal text reappears at the bottom of the text, (Maybe just redo the entire modal?)
- Add More UI enhancements: Title, About, Color Scale, Zoom
- Add Database of top posts (title and preview)
